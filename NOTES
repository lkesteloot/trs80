(Internal notes for developers.)

To add a dependency:

    npm -w packages/OUR_PACKAGE_NAME install --save THEIR_PACKAGE_NAME

No need to add dependencies between our own modules, they're all available
to each other.

---

To make a new release of trs80-tool, bump the version in its package.json
and commit/push. Github will build the binaries.
