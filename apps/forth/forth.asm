; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; This is a Forth interpreter. There are two stacks:
;
; - The data stack (PSP, for "parameter stack pointer") is used to pass data
;   between Forth routines. Between runs of interpreting lines, the Forth_psp
;   pointer points to this stack (the top item). Once interpreting starts, 
;   for speed we move the top item to the BC register and use the normal Z80
;   stack (using the SP register) for the rest.
; - The function return stack (RSP, "return stack pointer") is stored in memory
;   and pointed to by the IX register. Like the regular Z80 stack, is grows
;   downward and is pre-decremented and post-incremented.
;
; The HL register is the Forth "W" (working) register. We don't use this, though
; we use HL for all sorts of things that W would normally be used for, like computing
; addresses to jump to.
;
; The DE register is the Forth "IP" (instruction pointer) register. It points
; to the instruction that we should decode next.
;
; The dictionary of defined words is stored in a linked list. Each node contains:
;
; - Pointer to the previous entry in the dictionary, or NULL. (2 bytes)
; - Flags, which is either 0 or F_IMMED. (1 byte)
; - Nul-terminated name of the word.
; - Z80 code for the routine. For native routines this is just Z80 code. For compiled
;   routines this is a Z80 call to the "enter" routine followed by a sequence of
;   2-byte pointers to Forth words, terminated by the 2-byte address of "exit".
;
; This linked list is seeded with the built-in words at assembly time (!) by the
; M_forth_native macro. At runtime, the "init.fs" file is parsed to create additional
; useful words. The M_forth_word macro is similar to M_forth_native but has a call
; to "enter" first so that the rest of it can be just the two-byte pointers to
; the Forth native calls.

; The interpreter uses Direct Threaded Code. See this page for a description:
; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code

; There are two modes, immediate and compiling. The Forth_compiling word
; (accessible as "state" from Forth) is 1 if compiling and 0 if immediate.
;
; - In immediate mode, or if the word's F_IMMED flag is set, a word is executed
;   as it is parsed.
; - In compiling mode, the word's address is added to the code segment code
;   as it is parsed.
;
; The "[" word ("lbrac" here) goes into immediate mode and the "]"
; command ("rbrac" here) goes into compiling mode.
;
; A call to an immediate-mode word from a compiled routine is a way
; to run code at compile time. This code usually adds new code to the
; code segment procedurally, to create things like conditionals and
; loops.

; We set up a default program that reads the next word, executes it, and loops.
; After the user types in a line, we configure the interpreter (e.g., move the
; parameter stack from Forth_psp to the Z80 stack), then start executing, which
; starts parsing the line.

; The Forth_here pointer ("here" from Forth) is the location in our code segment
; where we will next add new code that we're compiling.

; The reason we use two-byte addresses and the DE register for PC is that
; if we used regular Z80 CALL commands, then that would interfere with our
; parameter stack. We have to choose whether we want to use the Z80 stack
; for parameters or call return, and here we choose parameters, on the assumption
; that messing with the parameter stack in Forth is more common than making
; function calls.

; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Calling convention used in this program
; ---------------------------------------
;
; Unless otherwise noted, the first parameter, and the return value are stored as follows:
; 8 bits: L
; 16 bits: HL
; 32 bits: DEHL
;
; Additional parameters are passed on the stack, left-to-right.
; Parameters and return values larger than 32 bits are passed on the stack (return value
; space set up by caller as a hidden first argument).
; Callee saves/restores any modified registers.
; Caller pops arguments after call returns.
; AF registers are scratch (caller preserves, if needed).
